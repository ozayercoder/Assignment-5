=> Some Question and Answear: 
  1. What is JSX, and why is it used in React?
  - JSX is what we write on a component. It helps us to write html on JavaScript
  2. What is the difference between props and state?
  - Props are the parameters what we recive or send to a function. and State is a hook of React that gives us a value and a function to update the value. Its mostly help us to rerender the UI.
  3. What does the useState hook do, and where did you use it in this project?
  - useState hook gives us a variable and a setter function to update the value of the variable. I used it on the functionality of buttons.
  4. What does the useEffect hook do, and why did you need it to load the JSON data?
  - useEffect hook helps us to load the JSON data without making a promise.
  5. Why does every item in a .map() list need a unique key prop?
  - 
  6. What is conditional rendering? Show one place you used it (example: the empty stack message).
  - conditional rendering means rendering the UI using a condition. As example I used it on the Your State section. When no stack is choosen the UI shows a div with a message. and when we choose any stack the UI shows the stack info on Your Stack section.
  7. How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component, and how does a child send something back to the parent?
  - We can pass data from a parent component to a child component as props. In reack unidirectional data passing is not allowed.
